# websys-loader
The goal of this project is to simplify executing wasm assemblies that execute against the proposed WebIDL spec for web assembly.

The goal is simple: enable web assembly developers to not have to know any javascript.

To do this I will use web components as much as possible for wasm module and configuration.
